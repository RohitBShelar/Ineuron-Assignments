Q1)Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?

Ans: Python is a generat purpose language as it is used for building softwares in a wide variety of application domains.
     It is a high level language as it can be easily comprehended by humans.
     
Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?

Ans:Dynamic typing means that the type of the variable is determined only during runtime.Theres no need for initial declaration of data type.

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?

Ans:
Pros:-
Beginner-friendly	
Large Community	
Embeddable
Flexible and Extensible	
Extensive Libraries	
Highly Scalable	
Portable
IoT Opportunities

Cons:-
Security
Issues with design
Slower than compiled languages
High memory consumption 
Dynamically-typed language
Complex multithreading
Garbage collection leads to potential memory losses

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?

Ans:-Python is used in the following domains:
Scientific Applications.
Business Applications.
Data Science
Artificial Intelligence.
Systems Programming.
Web Software.

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?

Ans:A variable in Python is a reserved memory location to store values. In other words, a variable in a python program gives data to the computer for processing. Declaring and re-declaring a variable in Python is as easy as writing names and assigning values to it.
There is no binding in Python to declare variables before we use it. We also need not explicitly declare variables with their data type. When we assign a value to Python variables, they are automatically declared.
We use the “=” operator for value assignment.
Eg:
If we want to declare a variable that should hold the marks we have, which is 10, we can do it in the following way –
marks=10

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?

Ans:input() function is used to take user input. 
By default, it returns the user input in form of a string.
Eg:
name = input("Please Enter Your Name: ") 
age = input("Please Enter Your Age: ")
print("Name & Age: ", name, age )

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?

Ans: string is the default datatype of input function which can be typecasted to any other type

Q8. What is type casting?

Ans:The conversion of one data type into the other data type is known as type casting.

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?

Ans:input() allows us to take only a single line string input which can be used to accept multiple values either space or comma separated and then can be separated using a split() function
input().split(separator)

Q10. What are keywords?

Ans:— Keywords in Python are reserved words that can not be used as a variable name, function name, or any other identifier.
Eg:Value Keywords: True, False, None.
Operator Keywords: and, or, not, in, is.
Control Flow Keywords: if, elif, else.
Iteration Keywords: for, while, break, continue, else.
Structure Keywords: def, class, with, as, pass, lambda.
Returning Keywords: return, yield.
Import Keywords: import, from, as.
